# Codecademy-CheatSheet-Project

This was my first attempt at completing the codecademy cheatsheet project. To be honest im not sure if I understood the requirements correctly.
I plan on improving it after seeing the solution and realizing how much better it could have turned out.
But this is my attempt without any training wheels or solution help. 
Any suggestions, comments, and concerns are appreciated !
